    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a.
        curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.</p>

    <p>Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic
        paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet
        flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into roughly 1-inch cubes</li>
